    "I started this from wanting to write down the few things that would have made my learning easier had I known them from the beginning. Many of those things (inevitably) now seem obvious, and this is probably part of the problem I faced at the time: the simple bits that everyone assumes everyone understands are only simple and obvious once you know them. Given that this book ended up creeping in scope, perhaps we should return to that original aim. What are the top-10 things that you really should take the time to understand from day 1, from practical to theoretical?\n",

    "1. Corollary: a vector of `n` items is not the same as a `1×n` array.\n",
    "1. Arrays can only contain scalars. This means that everything in an array must have rank-0, and thus higher-rank elements must be enclosed before they can go in an array.\n",
    "1. Cells are not equal to the element(s) they contain. Understand why pick (`⊃`) is different from squad (`⌷`).\n",
    "1. Enclosures are not shown in output by default. Turn on boxing with `]box on -s=min|mid|max`! This also helps with visualizing rank. \n",
    "1. Understand the leading axis idea and a lot of other things start to make sense.\n",

    "Learning APL is a rewarding pursuit. It certainly forced me to reexamine many calcified patterns in my own brain on what programming \"should be like\". It was frustrating at first, feeling that the process of learning a new language was slower than usual. If you can resist the reaction that this is somehow the fault of APL (\"It's unreadable!\"), you'll soon conquer that initial small hump on the learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing that I've found interesting is how many of your established \"best practices\" have evolved in completely different directions for APL. Aaron Hsu talks about this more eloquently than I ever could in his talk on [APL patterns and anti-patterns](https://www.sacrideo.us/apl-style-patterns-and-anti-patterns-in-apl/), but I'd like to highlight the following:\n",

    "> Good APL follows a set of best practices that directly contradict and conflict with traditional programming wisdom. Indeed, APL design patterns appear as Anti-patterns in most other programming languages. --_Aaron Hsu_\n",

    "If you're a Python programmer indoctrinated to believe in the Zen of Python ball and chain, you're probably cringing. In APL, the tacit style allows you to compress more meaning into the glyph count, like, for example the string split example above. This means that short phrases can be made even shorter, and thus become idioms that can be recognized as whole \"words\". See Aaron Hsu's [Co-defns](https://github.com/Co-dfns/) project for an awe-inspiring masterclass in what this can look like when you take this to the maxx.

Economy of notation is therefore important. Economy requires that a large number of ideas be expressible in terms of a relatively small vocabulary. A fundamental scheme for achieving this is the introduction of grammatical rules by which meaningful phrases and sentences can be constructed by combining elements of the vocabulary. --_Ken Iverson_\n",
