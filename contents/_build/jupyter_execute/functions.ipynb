    "Until now, we've mainly used APL as a toolkit for array manipulation using its built-in primitives. Sure, it goes a long way, but to fully take advantage of it, we also need to be able to create our own functions and operators. Fortunately, the syntax -- if we can even call it that -- for user-defined functions, is super-simple. As someone said on the APL Orchard chat room, all you need to do is \"slap curly braces around your code, and you're done\". It's not _quite_ that simple, but not too far off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a _dfn_ (direct function) is enclosed in a pair of curly braces. It's what's known as an anonymous function, or a lambda, in other languages, meaning that there is no syntactic sugar for naming a function beyond ordinary assignment using _Gets_, `←`:\n",
    "\n",

    "First a bit of unavoidable [yak shaving](https://xkcd.com/349/): if a dfn fits entirely on a single line, you can type it out directly in the RIDE IDE. So far, so expected. If your dfn extends across multiple lines, you can't (at the time of writing) just type it in. Dyalog is working on enhancing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the most convenient way to enter such a function is to say\n",
    "\n",
    "    )ed name\n",
    "   \n",
    "if you want to create a function called `name`. RIDE will open its function editor and let you enter your code there. Once you want to test your function, you first need to save it, which in APL-speak is called \"to fix your function\". The default way (and you're unlikely to ever discover this by yourself) to fix (save) your function is to hit <kbd>esc</kbd>. Yes, really. Fortunately -- and I recommend you do so right now -- RIDE allows you to re-bind keystrokes by clicking on the little keyboard symbol in the top-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locate the row that says \"Fix the current function\" and map that to the key combo that is `save` on your platform. And whilst you're there, make a note of the keys binding to \"Forward\" and \"Backward\" -- they default to <kbd>ctrl-shift-enter</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl-shift-backspace</kbd>. In the REPL, these mean forward/back in the history of executed lines, like the arrow keys in the shell. The arrow keys instead move up and down spatially, in the _output_, still, to me an incomprehensible design decision. You might also want to rebind \"Strong interrupt\" to <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> while you're at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing to note is that in RIDE there is no visual cue that an editor window contains unsaved changes. This is sure to bite you sooner or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter notebook, like here, entering functions might feel a bit more familiar: just type them into a cell. The only quirk is that in order to enter a multi-line dfn, you need to start the cell with `]dinput` (which isn't needed in a RIDE edit window). You _can_ actually use the `]dinput` way of entering a multi-line function in the interpreter REPL, too, but (in my opinion) it's rather cumbersome unless you're just cutting and pasting from somewhere else. In the upcoming (at the time of writing) version 18.1 there is experimental support for being able to type in multi-line functions directly in the REPL, similar to how that works in Python's REPL.\n",
